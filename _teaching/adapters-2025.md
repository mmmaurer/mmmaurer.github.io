This course introduces adapters, parameter efficient methods for adapting transformer-based language models to specific tasks. Adapters are lightweight and can be trained on small datasets, making them ideal for social science research where data may be limited. The course covers the theory behind adapters, practical implementation using the `adapters` library, and their application in various social science contexts. 

The course is designed for social scientists with a basic understanding of machine learning and natural language processing. Participants learned how to implement adapters in their research, enabling them to leverage the power of large language models without the need for extensive computational resources. Additional to theoretical and practical sessions, we provided individual consultations to help participants apply adapters to their specific research questions.
