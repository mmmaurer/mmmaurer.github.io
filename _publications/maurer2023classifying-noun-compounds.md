# Abstract
We investigate the diachronic evolution of the frequency and productivity of English noun compounds and their constituents relative to their degree of compositionality. We focus on 185 compounds with human compositionality ratings and a range of quantitative information from a large diachronic corpus. We cast our task as binary classification, and show that both diachronic frequency and productivity are useful in determining the present-day degree of compositionality of English noun compounds.
