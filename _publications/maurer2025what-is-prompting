excerpt: 'The guide gives a systematic overview of different prompting methods, their differences, and combinations. On a running example, it illustrates differences and overlaps between prompting methods. It contextualizes common methods, such as few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought, and persona prompting. Finally, it closes with words of caution and practical recommendations on issues of privacy, model hallucinations, and prompt brittleness and robustness.'

# Abstract
This guide introduces the concept of prompting, that is, querying large language models
(LLMs) using natural language. It presents and illustrates various prompting techniques
with a running example, showcasing their differences and how they can be combined.
Advanced techniques and concepts, such as reasoning models and persona prompting, are
also discussed. The guide concludes with a non-exhaustive list of risks and limitations that
users should be aware of. It is intended for users who have a basic conceptual
understanding of LLMs and wish to learn about different ways of prompting them for
research purposes.

Keywords: large language models, LLMs, generative language models, prompting
