# Hi there, I'm Max!

I'm a second year PhD student in the Data Science Methods team in the [Compuatational Social Science department](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/about-us/departments/computational-social-science) at GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Cologne, Germany, and at Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf.

My research focuses on linguistic and annotator-specific factors of (dis)agreement in text annotation and downstream effects on model behavior, in particular for subjective phenomena. I am also interested in the intersection of NLP and the social sciences, in particular in relation to variation in language, and representation and represenativeness in NLP datasets and models.
