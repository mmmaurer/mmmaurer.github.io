# ELFEN - Efficient Linguistic Feature Extraction for Natural Language Datasets
[ELFEN](https://github.com/mmmaurer/elfen) is a Python package for extracting linguistic features from text datasets at scale. It provides an extensive set of features that can be used to analyze text data and NLP model outputs. It is built on top of the modern dataframe package polars, allowing for handling large datasets efficiently. Preprocessing backbones are built on top of the popular NLP libraries spaCy and stanza, allowing for the use of both light-weight and state-of-the-art NLP models for feature extraction in various Languages.

For more information, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmmaurer/elfen) and the [documentation](https://elfen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
